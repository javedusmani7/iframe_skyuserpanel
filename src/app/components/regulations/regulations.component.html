            was made; or clearly incorrect given the chance of the event occurring at the time the bet was made then
            we reserve the right to
            cancel or void that wager, or to cancel or void a wager made after an event has started.
        </p>

        <p>
            We have the right to recover from you any amount overpaid and to adjust your account to rectify any
            mistake. An example of such a
            mistake might be where a price is incorrect or where we enter a result of an event incorrectly. If there
            are insufficient funds in
            your Account, we may demand that you pay us the relevant outstanding amount relating to any erroneous
            bets or wagers. Accordingly,
            we reserve the right to cancel, reduce or delete any pending plays, whether placed with funds resulting
            from the error or not.
        </p>

        <h3>10. General Rules</h3>

        <p>If a sport-specific rule contradicts a general rule, then the general rule will not apply.</p>

        <p>
            The winner of an event will be determined on the date of the event’s settlement; we do not recognise
            protested or overturned
            decisions for wagering purposes. The result of an event suspended after the start of competition will be
            decided according to the
            wagering rules specified for that sport by us.
        </p>

        <p>
            All results posted shall be final after 72 hours and no queries will be entertained after that period of
            time. Within 72 hours
            after results are posted, the company will only reset/correct the results due to human error, system
            error or mistakes made by the
            referring results source.
        </p>

        <p>
            Minimum and maximum wager amounts on all sporting events will be determined by us and are subject to
            change without prior written
            notice. We also reserve the right to adjust limits on individual Accounts as well.
        </p>

        <p>
            Customers are solely responsible for their own account transactions. Please be sure to review your
            wagers for any mistakes before
            sending them in. Once a transaction is complete, it cannot be changed. We do not take responsibility for
            missing or duplicate
            wagers made by the Customer and will not entertain discrepancy requests because a play is missing or
            duplicated. Customers may
            review their transactions in the My Account section of the site after each session to ensure all
            requested wagers were accepted.
        </p>

        <p>For a wager to have action on any named contestant in a Yes/No Proposition, the contestant must enter and
            compete in the event.</p>

        <p>
            We attempt to follow the normal conventions to indicate home and away teams by indicating the home and
            away team by means of
            vertical placement on the desktop site version. This means in American Sports we would place the home
            team on the bottom. For
            Non-US sports, we would indicate the home team on top. In the case of a neutral venue, we attempt to
            include the letter “N” next
            to the team names to indicate this. For the Asian and mobile versions, we do not distinguish between
            European and American Sports.
            On the Asian and mobile versions of the site, the home team is always listed first. However, we do not
            guarantee the accuracy of
            this information and unless there is an official venue change subsequent to bets being placed, all
            wagers have action.
        </p>

        <p>
            A game/match will have action regardless of the League heading that is associated with the matchup. For
            example, two teams from
            the same League are playing in a Cup competition. If the matchup is mistakenly placed in the League
            offering, the game/match will
            still have action, as long as the matchup is correct. In other words, a matchup will have action as long
            as the two teams are
            correct, and regardless of the League header in which it is placed on our Website.
        </p>

        <p>
            If an event is not played on the same date as announced by the governing body, then all wagers on the
            event have no action. If an
            event is posted by us, with an incorrect date, all wagers have action based on the date announced by the
            governing body.
        </p>

        <p>{{domain}} reserves the right to remove events, markets and any other product from the website.</p>

        <p>{{domain}} eserves the right to restrict the casino access of any player without prior notice.</p>

        <p>
            In all futures wagering (for example, total season wins, Super Bowl winner, etc.), the winner as
            determined by the Governing Body
            will also be declared the winner for betting purposes except when the minimum number of games required
            for the future to have
            “action” has not been completed.

        <h3>14. Gambling By Those Under Age</h3>

        <p>
            If we suspect that you are or receive notification that you are currently under 18 years or were under
            18 years (or below the age
            of majority as stipulated in the laws of the jurisdiction applicable to you) when you placed any bets
            through the service your
            account will be suspended to prevent you placing any further bets or making any withdrawals from your
            account. We will then
            investigate the matter, including whether you have been betting as an agent for, or otherwise on behalf,
            of a person under 18
            years (or below the age of majority as stipulated in the laws of the jurisdiction applicable to you). If
            having found that you:
            (a) are currently; (b) were under 18 years or below the majority age which applies to you at the
            relevant time; or © have been
            betting as an agent for or at the behest of a person under 18 years or below the majority age which
            applies:
        </p>

        <p>
            ii. all winnings gained from betting through the service whilst under age must be paid to us on demand
            (if you fail to comply with
            this provision we will seek to recover all costs associated with recovery of such sums); and/or
        </p>

        <p>iii. any monies deposited in your {{domain}} account which are not winnings will be returned to you.</p>

        <p>
            This condition also applies to you if you are over the age of 18 years but you are placing your bets
            within a jurisdiction which
            specifies a higher age than 18 years for legal betting and you are below that legal minimum age in that
            jurisdiction.

        <p>
            In the event we suspect you are in breach of the provisions of this Clause 15 or are attempting to rely

        <h3>Restricted territory information</h3>
        <p>Please be advised that our restricted territory information pertains to both residents and visitors in the
            restricted areas. Accounts
            registered in a non-restricted territory will become restricted if they are attempt to access and have
            betting activity from a
            territory which is restricted.</p>

            territories) </p>
        <p>We have the right to void all players winnings if they are deemed to come from a restricted territory.</p>

        <h3>1. Use and interpretation</h3>
        <p>The Exchange Rules and Regulations ("Exchange Rules") are part of terms and conditions.</p>
        <p>The Exchange Rules apply to all bets placed on Exchange markets. The Exchange Rules also apply to Exchange
            ’Multiples’ product (see the
            Multiples section below for further details). The Exchange Rules consist of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This INTRODUCTION section (Part A);</li>
            <li>The GENERAL RULES (set out in Part B below);</li>
            <li>The SPECIFIC SPORTS RULES (set out in Part C below – these apply to certain sports and to financial
                markets); and</li>
            <li>The MARKET INFORMATION (located on every market either under the tab entitled "Rules" or under the
                ‘Rules’).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The General Rules apply to all bets unless stated otherwise in the Market Information or the Specific Sports
            Rules. If there is any
            inconsistency between the Specific Sports Rules and the General Rules, the Specific Sports Rules shall
            prevail. If there is any
            inconsistency between the Market Information and either the General Rules or the Specific Sports Rules, the
            Market Information shall
            prevail, except where the General Rules or Specific Sports Rules use the phrase 'regardless of what it says
            in the Market Information'
            or similar wording.</p>
        <p>For any category or market not referred to in the Specific Sports Rules (e.g. ’Special Bets’ or beach
            volleyball), the General Rules
            and Market Information will apply.</p>

        <h3>2. Market information</h3>
        <p>The Market Information is provided for information purposes as an at-a-glance guide on how to manage the
            market. The Market Information
            may also contain rules on market settlement, however it must always be read in conjunction with the General
            Rules and the relevant
            Specific Sports Rules and a link to this Rules and Regulations page will usually be provided in the Market
            Information for each
            market.</p>
        <p>Whilst the Market Information may give a guide to how markets will be managed, regardless of what it says in
            the Market Information, it
            reserves the right to suspend any market at any time at its sole discretion, including in order to carry out
            necessary administration
            and/or to take any necessary action to protect the customers.</p>
        <p>It shall not amend the Market Information after a market has been loaded except to correct obvious errors
            and/or to add wording to
            clarify the Market Information where appropriate.</p>
        <h3>3. Customer responsibility</h3>
        <p>The customers should make themselves aware of all the Exchange Rules affecting any market on which they wish
            to place a bet. Customers
            should not simply rely on the Market Information as the Market Information is unlikely to contain all of the
            applicable rules relating
            to a market.</p>
        <p>By their nature ‘Special Bets’ markets are unpredictable so should be treated with particular caution.
            Customers are responsible for
            managing their own positions at all times in such markets. Customers should pay particular attention to the
            Market Information on
            ‘Special Bets’ markets to ensure they understand the basis on which the market will be administered and
            settled.</p>
        <h3>4. Customer betting disputes &amp; IBAS</h3>
        <p>Any customer who has any concerns or questions regarding the Exchange Rules or regarding the settlement of
            any market should
            contact.</p>
        <p>If a customer is not satisfied with how a bet or a market has been settled then the customer should provide
            details of their
            grievance.</p>

        <h2>Part B - General rules</h2>
        <h3>1. Managing markets In-Play</h3>
        <h4>a) General</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                For everything other than horseracing and greyhound racing, if a market is not scheduled to be turned
                in-play but fails to suspend
                the market at the relevant time, then:
                <ul>
                    <li>if the event has a scheduled 'off' time, all bets matched after that scheduled off time will be
                        void; and</li>
                    <li>if the event does not have a scheduled 'off' time, it will use its reasonable endeavours to
                        ascertain the time of the
                        actual 'off' and all bets after the time of the 'off' determined will be void.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>For horseracing and greyhound racing, if a market is not scheduled to be turned in-play but fails to
                suspend the market at the
                relevant time, then all bets matched after the official 'off' time will be void.
            </li>
            <li>It aims to use its reasonable endeavours to suspend in-play markets at the start of and at the end of
                the event. However,
                regardless of what it says in the Market Information, it does not guarantee that such markets will be
                suspended at the relevant
                time.
            </li>
            <li>It will not part-suspend outcomes/selections in an Exchange market that has been turned in-play.</li>
            <li>Customers are responsible for managing their in-play bets at all times.</li>
            <li>For the purposes of in-play betting, customers should be aware that transmissions described as "live" by
                some broadcasters may be
                delayed or pre-recorded. The extent of any delay may vary depending on the set-up through which they are
                receiving pictures or
                data.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>b) All markets other than soccer markets and Australian markets - not suspending at the time of the 'off'
        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>In relation to markets which are scheduled to be turned in-play, aims to use its reasonable endeavours
                to turn such markets
                in-play at the time of the 'off'. The time of the 'off' for such markets should be set out in the Market
                Information. However,
                regardless of what it says in the Market Information, it does not guarantee that such markets will be
                suspended and turned in-play
                at the time of the 'off'.
            </li>

                at the time of the 'off'
                and the market is not turned in-play with unmatched bets cancelled at any time during the event, all
                bets matched after the
                scheduled time of the 'off' will be void (in the case of horseracing and greyhound racing, bets will be

                the time of the actual 'off'
                and all bets after the time of the 'off' determined will be void.

                cancelled at that time), but the market is intentionally turned in-play at a later time during the

        <h4>c) Soccer markets (with the exception of Australian soccer markets) - not suspending at kick-off or on the
            occurrence of a Material
            Event</h4>
        <h5>Not suspending at kick-off</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>In relation to soccer markets that are scheduled to be turned in-play, aims to use its reasonable
                endeavours to turn such markets
                in-play at kick-off and to suspend such markets on the occurrence of a Material Event (see definition of
                "Material Event" below).
            </li>
            <li>The relevant scheduled kick-off time should be set out in the Market Information. However, regardless of
                what it says in the
                Market Information, it does not guarantee that such markets will be suspended and turned in-play at
                kick-off.
            </li>
            <li>If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but not suspend the market at kick-off and the market is
                not turned in-play at any
                time during the match, all bets matched after the scheduled time of the kick-off will be void.
            </li>
            <li>If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but not suspend the market at kick-off (so unmatched bets
                are not cancelled at that
                time), but the market is turned in-play at a later time during the match, all bets matched after the
                scheduled time of the
                kick-off and before the first "Material Event" will stand. However, if there has been one or more
                "Material Events", any bets
                matched between the first "Material Event" and the market being turned in-play will be void.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Not suspending on the occurrence of a Material Event</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>If it does not suspend a market on time for the occurrence of a Material Event, it reserves the right to
                void bets unfairly
                matched after the Material Event has occurred. Voiding of these bets may take place during the event or
                retrospectively once a
                game is completed.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Definition of “Material Event”</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>For the purpose of these Exchange Rules, a "Material Event" shall mean a goal being scored, a penalty
                being awarded or a player
                being sent off.
            </li>

        <h4>d) In-play Australian markets</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Notwithstanding the other in-play rules described above, in relation specifically to any Australian
                market that is scheduled to be
                turned in-play, if it fails to suspend the market at the 'off' then all bets matched after the scheduled
                time of the 'off' and
                before the market is turned in-play will be void (in the case of horseracing and greyhound racing, bets
                will be void from the
                official rather than the scheduled ‘off’ time). If the event does not have a scheduled 'off' time, it
                will use its reasonable
                endeavours to ascertain the time of the actual 'off' and all bets after the time of the 'off' as
                determined will be void.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Results and market settlement</h3>
        <h4>a) General</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Markets will be settled as set out in the Market Information and/or the Specific Sports Rules.</li>
            <li>Where the Market Information or Specific Sports Rules do not specify how and on what basis a market will
                be settled, markets will
                be settled on the official result of the relevant governing body regardless of any subsequent
                disqualification or amendment to the
                result (except if an amendment is announced within 24 hours of the initial settlement of the relevant
                market in order to correct
                an error in reporting the result).
            </li>
            <li>If no official result of a relevant governing body is available, the result will be determined by using
                information from
                independent sources. In such cases, if any new information comes into the public domain within 48 hours
                of settlement, then it
                shall (acting reasonably) determine either: (i) whether the market should be reinstated or resettled in
                light of this new
                information; or (ii) whether or not to wait for further information before deciding whether to reinstate
                or resettle the market.
                Except it has announced that it is waiting for further information, any information that comes into the
                public domain more than 48
                hours after a market has been settled shall not be considered (regardless of whether or not such
                information may have led to a
                different result).
            </li>
            <li>In the event of any uncertainty about any result or potential result, it reserves the right to suspend
                settlement of any market
                for an unlimited period until the uncertainty can be resolved to the reasonable satisfaction. It
                reserves the right to void any
                market if the uncertainty regarding settlement cannot be resolved to reasonable satisfaction.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>b) Resettlements</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Markets are generally settled shortly after the end of the event in question. It may settle (or
                part-settle) some markets before
                the official result is declared (or may increase a customer's 'available to bet' balance by the minimum
                potential winnings of that
                customer on a given market) purely as a customer service benefit. However, it reserves the right to
                amend the settlement of the
                market if: (i) the official result is different to the result on which initially settled the market (for
                example, a horseracing
                result being changed by the relevant governing body shortly after a race, but before the result is
                official); or (ii) if the whole
                market is eventually voided (e.g. for an abandoned event).
            </li>
            <li>It reserves the right to reverse the settlement of a market if a market is settled in error (for
                example, a human or technical
                error).
            </li>
            <li>If resettles a market, this may lead to amendments being made to a customer's balance to reflect changes
                in market settlement.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>c) Non-runners, withdrawals and disqualifications</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Subject always right to void bets under its terms and conditions or for any exception under the Exchange
                Rules, if a market
                contains a statement that says, "All bets stand, run or not" (or something similar) in the Market
                Information, then all bets on a
                team or competitor will stand regardless of whether or not the team or competitor starts the event or
                takes any part in the event.
            </li>
            <li>Where the Market Information does not stipulate that all bets will stand regardless of participation,
                customers should refer to
                the relevant Specific Sports Rules.
            </li>
            <li>If a team or competitor is disqualified, withdraws or forfeits after starting an event they will be
                deemed a loser providing at
                least one other team or competitor completes the event. If no team or competitor completes an event
                (having started) then all bets
                will be void except for bets on any markets which have been unconditionally determined.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>d) Winner with [named selection]' markets</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>It may from time to time offer markets that are dependent on the participation of a particular
                competitor. If the competitor named
                either in a 'Winner with …' market title or in the Market Information does not participate in the
                tournament or event then all
                bets on the market will be void. For example, if there was a "Winner with Federer" tennis market, all
                bets on the market would be
                void if Federer did not participate in the tournament. However, if any other competitor did not
                participate, then bets would
                stand.
            </li>
            <li>A team or competitor will be deemed to have participated if they have taken part to the extent necessary
                to record an official
                result or classification (including any disqualification but excluding any "did not start" or equivalent
                classification).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Abandonments, Cancellations, Postponements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the Specific Sports Rules and/or the Market
                Information. However, where
                a market has no rules in the Specific Sports Rules or the Market Information in relation to an
                abandonment, cancellation and/or
                postponement the following shall apply.
            </li>
            <li>In relation to any match, fixture, game, individual event, race or similar: If the event is not
                completed within three days after
                the scheduled completion date, then all bets on markets for this event will be void, except for bets on
                any markets that have been
                unconditionally determined.
            </li>
            <li>In relation to any tournament, competition or similar: If the event is not completed within three days
                after the scheduled
                completion date, then any markets relating to the event will be settled in accordance with the official
                ruling of the relevant
                governing body, providing such a decision is given within 90 days after the scheduled completion date.
                If no official ruling is
                announced in this 90-day period, then bets on any market relating to this event will be void, except for
                bets on any markets which
                have been unconditionally determined. If a market is to be voided but has been part-settled as a
                courtesy to customers, then such
                part-settled bets will be reversed and all bets on the market will be void.
            </li>
            <li>It will decide (acting reasonably) whether a market relates to a match (or similar) or a tournament (or
                similar). However, by way
                of example, the following shall apply: (i) Europa League outright = tournament; (ii) Champions’ League
                Group outright =
                tournament; (iii) Top Premiership goal scorer = tournament; (iv) 72-hole Golf Match bet = match; (v)
                Ryder Cup outright =
                tournament; (vi) Golf tournament outright = tournament; (vii) Tennis Tournament outright =
                tournament;(viii) 5-day Cricket Test
                Match = match; (ix) Ashes Series outright winner = tournament; (x) Motor Race (e.g. Grand Prix) = match.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Change of venue</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the Specific Sports Rules and/or the Market
                Information. However, if
                change of venue is not dealt with in the Specific Sports Rules and/or the Market Information then the
                following shall apply:
            </li>
            <li>For any team sport: if the scheduled venue is changed after the market is loaded, all bets will be void
                only if the new venue is a
                home ground of the original away team
            </li>
            <li>For all categories or markets other than team sports: if the scheduled venue is changed after the market
                is loaded, all bets will
                stand.
            </li>
            <li>If there is a change in the type of scheduled surface (e.g. a hockey match switching from grass to
                Astor-turf) after the market
                has been loaded, all bets will stand.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Periods of time</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the Specific Sports Rules and/or the Market
                Information. However, if not
                dealt with in the Specific Sports Rules or the Market Information then the following shall apply.
            </li>
            <li>If the scheduled duration of an event is changed after the market has been loaded but before the start
                of the event, then all bets
                will be void.
            </li>
            <li>Some markets refer to the length of time until an occurrence in the event (e.g. time of first goal). If
                an event happens in
                stoppage or injury time after any regular time period then it will be deemed to have occurred at the end
                of the regular time
                period. For example, if a goal is scored in first half stoppage-time in a soccer match it will be deemed
                to have occurred on 45
                minutes.
            </li>
            <li>All bets apply to the relevant full 'regular time' period including stoppage time. Any extra-time and/or
                penalty shoot-out is not
                included.
            </li>
            <li>References within these Rules and Regulations to a particular number of 'days' shall mean the end of the
                day local time after the
                expiry of the specified number of days. For example, if a rugby match is scheduled for the 1st of
                December, then the rule that
                allows the match to be completed within three days after the scheduled completion date (see Paragraph 3
                above) would mean that the
                deadline for completion of that match would be 23.59:59 on the 4th of December.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6. Match bets</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the Specific Sports Rules and/or the Market
                Information. For example,
                for match bets on Golf markets the rules are set out in the Specific Sports Rules. However, if not dealt
                with in the Specific
                Sports Rules or the Market Information then the following shall apply.
            </li>
            <li>'Match Bets' for one-off events are determined by the competitor or team with the best score, time or
                finishing position in the
                event. If none of the competitors or teams involved in the match bet complete the event or register a
                score, time or finishing
                position then bets are void unless specified otherwise in the Specific Sports Rules and/or the Market
                Information. Any competitor
                or team not completing an event or registering a score, time or finishing position having taken part in
                the match bet event will
                be settled as a loser providing at least one other team or competitor completes that event or registers
                a score, time or finishing
                position.
            </li>
            <li>'Match Bets' for progress in a competition or event with multiple heats or rounds are determined by the
                competitor or team which
                qualifies to the furthest round (whether it takes part in the further round or not) or with the best
                score, time or finishing
                position in the final or same heat of that competition or event. If the relevant competitors or teams
                fail to qualify in the same
                round of the competition but in different heats then dead-heat rules will apply, irrespective of the
                finishing positions in their
                respective heats. Markets will be part-settled after the end of each round and any subsequent
                disqualifications, penalties or
                amendments to results or qualifications will not have any effect on the market. Where one or more of the
                competitors or teams are
                disqualified, for the purposes of settlement, the disqualified competitor or team will be deemed to have
                progressed further in the
                competition or event than all those eliminated from the competition or event prior to the
                disqualification, and will be deemed to
                have finished last (or joint last if there is more than one disqualification) of those still competing
                in the competition or
                event. Disqualification will be considered to have taken place at the time of the competitor's or team's
                removal from the
                competition or event by the relevant governing body, rather than at the time of the event which caused
                disqualification.
            </li>
            <li>If one of the competitors or teams does not take any part in the event, then all relevant match bets
                will be void.</li>
            <li>If an event or tournament is abandoned or reduced in duration such that any competitor or team fails to
                complete the match bet,
                event or tournament for any reason other than withdrawal or disqualification then all bets will be void
                except for those on
                markets which have been unconditionally determined.

            <li>Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the Specific Sports Rules and/or the Market
                Information. However, if not
                dealt with in the Specific Sports Rules or the Market Information then the following shall apply.
            </li>
            <li>Any 'to qualify' market (e.g. "to reach the final" markets) will be determined by the competitor or team
                that qualifies under the
                terms set out in Market Information, whether or not they take part in the next round or event for which
                they have qualified.
                Markets will be settled after the qualifying stage and any subsequent disqualification or amendment to
                the result will not count.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>8. Dead heats</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Unless stated otherwise in the Specific Sports Rules and/or the Market Information the Dead Heat Rule
                applies to bets on a market
                where there are more winners than expected (as set out in the Market Information).
            </li>
            <li>For each bet matched on a relevant winning selection, the stake money is first reduced in proportion by
                multiplying it by the sum
                of the number of winners expected (as set out in the Market Information), divided by the number of
                actual winners (i.e. stake
                multiplied by (number of winners expected/number of actual winners)). The winnings are then paid to the
                successful backers on this
                'reduced stake' (reduced stake multiplied by traded price) and the remaining stake money is paid to the
                appropriate layers.
            </li>
            <li>For example, assume there is a dead heat for first place between three horses. 'Client A' has backed one
                of the winners for a
                stake of 300 at the traded price of 4.0 and 'Client B' has taken the other side of this bet. When the
                event is settled, the stake
                (300) is multiplied by 1/3 (i.e. the number of expected winners (1) divided by the number of actual
                winners (3)) to calculate the
                reduced stake (100) and the remainder given to the layer (200). The backer then receives the traded
                price matched (4.0) multiplied
                by the reduced stake (4 x 100 = 400). In this example, Client A's net winnings are 100 (400 payout minus
                the original 300 stake),
                and Client B's net losses are 100. Alternatively, this can be viewed as the full amount paid to the
                traded price divided by the
                number of dead-heaters. In the above example, this would be 300 at the traded price of 4.0 (1200)
                divided by 3; making 400 payouts
                and 100 net winnings.
            </li>
            <li>By way of another example, assume there is an outright winner in a golf tournament but 7 players tie for
                2nd place. In the "top 5
                finish" market, after settling on the outright winner in the top 5 market there would be 4 others
                designated winner’s places
                available. 'Client A' has backed one of the winners for 300 at the traded price of 4.0 and 'Client B'
                has taken the other side of
                this bet. When the event is settled, the stake (300) is multiplied by 4/7 (i.e. the number of expected
                winners (4) divided by the
                number of actual winners (7)) to calculate the reduced stake (171.43) and the remainder given to the
                layer (128.57). The backer
                then receives the traded price matched (4.0) multiplied by the reduced stake (4 x 171.43 = 685.72). In
                this example, Client A's
                net winnings are 385.72 (685.72 payout minus the original 300 stake), and Client B's net losses are
                385.72.
            </li>
            <li>In relation to customers whose betting counterparty, for the purposes of this section of the Exchange
                Rules dealing with dead
                heats, the terms 'Client A', 'Client B' and 'appropriate layers' should, where relevant, be read
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>9. Exchange Multiples</h3>
        <p>The Exchange Rules only apply to Exchange Multiples. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Customers placing a multiple bet will be betting with each other will act as the counterparty to the
                bet.</li>
            <li>A multiple bet consists of a number of legs. A leg is defined as one or more chosen selections in any
                individual event market.
            </li>
            <li>It reserves the right in its sole discretion not to accept certain multiple bets or to scale back stakes
                in certain
                circumstances.
            </li>
            <li>All multiple bets placed are subject to the Exchange Rules that apply to each individual sport that
                relates to any leg of any
                multiple bet.
            </li>
            <li>The maximum payout limit for Exchange Multiples is £1,000,000.</li>
            <li>Customers can place an Exchange Multiple bet using back, or where available lay or a mixture of back and
                lay selections. However,
                customers cannot have a combination of back and lay selections in any one leg.
            </li>
            <li>If customers choose more than one selection in one leg the odds for this leg will be "dutched" which
                means they will be combined
                to reflect the chances of any of the selections within the leg winning (if backed) or all of the
                selections losing (if laid). If
                customers wish to place a cross-multiple bet (i.e. more than one selection in any event market but not
                using "dutched" prices)
                they will need to enter each Exchange Multiple bet separately.
            </li>
            <li>Other than Exchange Multiples bets struck at Starting Price ("BSP"), the odds available via the Exchange
                Multiples product will be
                broadly based on the relevant singles markets on the Exchange and any such winning multiple bet will be
                subject to commission as
                set out in the Charges' section of the website.
            </li>
            <li>Any winnings from Exchange Multiples bets struck at BSP will not be subject to commission, but the odds
                returned on each leg in
                such a multiple will be subject to a 5% deduction from the BSP.
            </li>
            <li>A BSP each way Exchange Multiple bet is a bet for selections in the multiple to win and a bet on the
                same selections to place. For
                example, a £2 each way double represents a £2 bet on both selections to win and a £2 bet on both
                selections to be placed, with a
                total stake for the bet of £4. The number of places for each event in each way multiples bet are shown
                on the multiples win Market
                Information and do not change. Should the number of runners be equal to or less than the number of
                places available, the relevant
                place leg of any multiples bet will be void
            </li>
            <li>The minimum total stake for any Exchange Multiple bet is £2. For example, a 20p "Yankee" (11 bet
                combinations) representing a
                total stake of £2.20 is permitted. However, a 1p "Heinz" (57 bet combinations) representing a total
                stake of £0.57 or a £1 double
                (1 bet combination) representing a total stake of £1 will not be permitted. For customers betting in
                currencies other than English
                Sterling, the minimum total stake which applies to an Exchange Multiple bet will not necessarily be the
                equivalent of £2, though
                it will be calculated as described in the example above.
            </li>
            <li>If, in its sole discretion, will determine the markets that are available for Exchange Multiples. Events
                available for Exchange
                Multiples will be those listed within any individual Exchange Multiple group (e.g. UK football fixtures
                for any given day). Not
                all markets will be available via the Exchange Multiples product.
            </li>
            <li>With the exception of the rule directly below, if any selection in any leg is a non-runner or otherwise
                void under the Exchange
                Rules (e.g. an abandoned match) then all bets on that individual leg will be void and the Exchange
                Multiple bet shall be adjusted
                accordingly. For example, a treble including one void leg will become a double. This means that if
                customers have more than one
                selection in any leg (i.e. in cases of 'ditching') and one of those selections is a non-runner, the
                whole leg will be void. In the
                event that voided legs mean that an individual bet within a multiple becomes a single bet, then this
                single bet will stand.
            </li>
            <li>Notwithstanding the rule directly above, for Exchange Multiples bets struck at BSP, if customers have
                more than one selection in
                any leg and one of those selections is a non-runner the leg will stand. For example, if customers back
                both Desert Orchid and Red
                Rum in an individual horse race and Red Rum is a non-runner, the leg will become a back of just Desert
                Orchid.
            </li>
            <li>It reserves the right not to accept certain combinations of Exchange Multiples, such as those including
                related contingencies
                (i.e. where the outcome of one event is likely to affect the odds on the outcome of another event). This
                may happen automatically
                at the bet placement stage. Alternatively, if such bet is taken in error, it may void the individual bet
                combinations which
                include two or more of the related contingency selections.
            </li>
            <li>It may offer special markets on related events from time to time, including within its normal markets
                (i.e. outside of the
                Exchange Multiples product), for example a market on Chelsea to win the English domestic double (i.e.
                Premiership and FA Cup).
            </li>
            <li>When placing any Exchange Multiple bet, the prices shown only give an indicative guide as to the price
                available for each leg and
                the overall multiple. Other than Exchange Multiples bets struck at BSP, the price of each leg and the
                overall multiple price that
                customers get will be fixed when the multiple bet is actually placed and customers will then be able to
                see these prices. For more
                details on this customer should refer to the 'help' files.
            </li>
            <li>Horseracing Exchange Multiples are based on ‘day of the race’ markets (and not ante-post markets).
                Horseracing ante-post rules do
                not therefore apply in relation to horseracing Exchange Multiples.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>10. Rules for Starting Price</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Starting Price ('SP') is available on the Exchange. Exchange SP bets (‘SP bets’) are therefore a type of
                Exchange bet. The SP is
                calculated as, by balancing all SP bets and other Exchange bets when the market is suspended at the
                'off' of the relevant event.
                The details of this calculation are provided directly below.
            </li>
            <li>Please note that for all customers, an SP bet cannot be cancelled once it has been placed.</li>
            <li>A bet at SP is a fixed odd bet, with the odds on each selection being calculated and bets matched when
                the event starts. The odds
                are calculated by matching SP backers and other Exchange backers against SP layers and other Exchange
                layers. The inclusion of
                other Exchange bets in the SP reconciliation is necessary to ensure that: SP backers get the benefit of
                unmatched Exchange offers
                to lay if those offers could increase the SP; and SP layers get the benefit of unmatched Exchange offers
                to back if those offers
                could reduce the SP. Including unmatched other Exchange in the SP reconciliation also ensures that the
                bets of other Exchange
                backers and layers, which would otherwise lapse, are matched where possible.
            </li>
            <li>The minimum liability for a bet placed at SP is £10 for a lay bet and £2 for a back bet (or the currency
                equivalent in each
                case).
            </li>
            <li>Example 1: on selection A there is £1,000 of backers' stakes and £6,000 of layers' liabilities at SP and
                there are £500 of
                unmatched other Exchange back bets available to lay at an average of 5.0. If we ignored the Exchange
                market in this case the SP
                would be 7.0. However, this would leave other Exchange back bets, that could also have been matched at
                their requested price
                against SP layers, unmatched. Therefore, the SP will be 5.0 and all SP backers and SP layers will be
                matched at that price. The
                £500 of Exchange backers' stakes will also be matched at their requested price of 5.0 against the SP
                layers.
            </li>
            <li>Example 2: on selection B there are £831 of backers' stakes and £4,428 of layers' liabilities at SP and
                the following unmatched
                other Exchange lay bets, available to back: £20 at 6.8, £31.13 at 6.6 and £100 at 6.4. In this case the
                SP will be 6.68. This is
                calculated by including the £20 available to back at 6.8 and the £31.13 available to back at 6.6 and
                balancing those amounts
                against the SP backers' stakes and SP layers' liabilities. The £100 available to back on the Exchange at
                6.4 remains unmatched as
                to include any of this amount would lead to an imbalance between SP backers and SP layers.
            </li>
            <li>The SP is calculated to six decimal places for each selection, though it may be displayed in the
                relevant market view (or in any
                form/results data) to two decimal places, rounded up or down as applicable. After reconciliation, the
                full SP on each selection is
                available by clicking on the relevant individual runner graph.
            </li>
            <li>If for whatever reason the site is unavailable when an event starts or the SP cannot otherwise be
                reconciled at the 'off’, it will
                determine the SP using all available information. For the avoidance of doubt this information will not
                be limited to betting
                activity on the relevant market(s). Also in these circumstances, a licensed betting operator within the
                group may act as risk
                counterparty to SP bets if necessary to ensure a fair SP. The personnel involved in determining the SP
                in such circumstances will
                have no undeclared personal or other interest in the SP in question.
            </li>
            <li>If the SP reconciliation process is undertaken prematurely (for example if a horserace is turned in-play
                in error), then it will
                endeavor to reverse the reconciliation so that the SP is determined when the event starts. There may
                however be circumstances in
                which this is not possible, in which case the SP will be based on the initial reconciliation.
            </li>
            <li>In cases where an SP reconciliation is reversed: SP bets (including SP limit bets), 'At In-play: Take
                SP' bets and 'At In-play:
                Keep' bets will all revert to their status before the reconciliation; and 'At In-play: Cancel' bets will
                either remain cancelled
                if not matched as part of the reconciliation process, or if matched as part of the reconciliation
                process, will revert to their
                unmatched status before the reconciliation.
            </li>
            <li>If the SP reconciliation process is undertaken later than scheduled (i.e. after the event has started)
                and determines that a
                material event has occurred (this will generally mean that the event is not turned in-play), the SP will
                be determined based
                solely on SP bets (and ‘At In-play: Take SP’ bets which are unmatched when suspends the relevant
                market), placed before the 'off'.
                This means that ‘At In-play: Take SP’ bets matched after the off, will be made void and not included in
                the reconciliation
                process. In addition, SP bets placed after the 'off' will be voided. However, if the SP reconciliation
                process is undertaken later
                than scheduled but determines that no material event has occurred, all bets will stand.
            </li>
            <li>If a SP 'each way' option is offered this will be processed as two separate bets: a win bet at SP and a
                'to be placed' bet at
                SP.
            </li>
            <li>If for any reason unmatched bets are cancelled prior to a market going in-play, then any unmatched bets
                that have been selected to
                'At In-play: Take SP' will be converted to SP bets. Once those bets are converted, they cannot be
                cancelled.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>➢ Party against whom you are betting at SP</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>When you place a bet at SP you are betting against other customers. However, during the reconciliation
                of the SP, it acts as
                counterparty in order to balance liabilities between SP bets and other Exchange bets
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>➢ Placing a SP bet</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Selecting the 'SP' button in the market view gives customers two different ways to request an SP bet.
                These are as follows:</li>
            <li>The first way to request a bet at SP is by leaving the 'Set SP odds limit' box unticked at the top right
                of the bet manager. For a
                back bet you are required to enter the stake you wish to bet on the selection. For a lay bet, you are
                required to enter the
                liability you are prepared to risk against the selection – in other words the amount that you are
                prepared to lose, should the
                selection win (or be placed as applicable).
            </li>
            <li>The second way to request a bet at SP is to select the 'Set SP odds limit' option. Using this you can
                request a bet at SP
                conditional upon minimum SP odds in the case of a back bet, or maximum SP odds in the case of a lay bet.
                If SP is shorter than the
                minimum price requested by a backer or is longer than the maximum price requested by a layer, then the
                relevant bet will lapse
                when the event starts. If SP is longer than the minimum price requested by a backer or is shorter than
                the maximum price requested
                by a layer, the bet will be matched at the SP. Where an SP is equal to the price limit specified by
                customers, those bets will be
                included based on the time they were submitted, on a first come, first served basis as is the existing
                convention for other
                Exchange bets. This means that such bets may be unmatched or partially matched.
            </li>
            <li>Please note that if a non-runner cannot be removed from the relevant market until after the completion
                of the event, the
                application to all bets matched at or before the "off" (including SP bets) of any reduction factor, may
                mean that the matched
                price for an SP back bet with an odds limit requested, is adjusted to a price below the lower limit
                requested. It may also mean
                that an SP lay bet request with maximum odds requested, may not be matched even though the odds on the
                selection, after any
                post-race adjustment for the late non-runner, is below the maximum odds requested.
            </li>
            <li>If an SP bet with an odds limit is requested, the minimum/maximum odds requested can be shortened in the
                case of a back bet or a
                lengthened in the case of a lay bet at any time before the event starts. However, as mentioned above, an
                SP bet request cannot
                actually be cancelled by a customer once it has been placed. Details of the impact of non-runners on the
                SP re provided below.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>➢ Exchange bets which are unmatched at the 'off'</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>A normal Exchange bet is placed by choosing the odds of your selection from the market view (as opposed
                to clicking on the 'SP' of
                your selection). When such an Exchange bet is fully or partially unmatched it can be adjusted and
                cancelled in the normal course.
                Previously, unmatched bets were automatically cancelled when a market was suspended at the 'off' of the
                relevant event. You can
                now choose to either have your unmatched Exchange bet convert to an SP bet when the market suspends at
                the start of the event, or
                to have the bet 'persist' when the event goes in-play (see the 'keep' option below).
            </li>
            <li>In order to convert your unmatched Exchange bet to an SP bet when the market suspends you should select
                the 'At In-Play: Take SP'
                option in the bet manager. If there is a non-runner in a win market with a reduction factor of at least
                2.5%, or a non-runner in a
                place market with a reduction factor of at least 4%, it is policy to cancel unmatched lay bets on all
                other runners in the market.
                In the case of any such non-runner, instead of being cancelled a lay bet for which the 'At In-Play: Take
                SP' option has been
                selected, will automatically convert to an SP bet. After this conversion, the bet cannot be cancelled.
                Otherwise, unlike an SP
                bet, you can choose to cancel an Exchange bet once it has been placed, even if you have chosen for the
                bet to persist or to
                convert to an SP bet at the start of the event.
            </li>
            <li>If you choose to convert an unmatched Exchange lay bet to an SP bet, the liability of your Exchange lay
                bet will be converted into
                a liability for the SP bet. Your liability for that SP bet will never be more than the liability for the
                Exchange bet you had
                specified. However, the amount you can win on the SP lay bet may differ from the amount you would have
                won had the Exchange bet
                been matched, depending on the final SP.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>➢ Adjustments to SP bets for non-runners</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>For SP back bets, will at no point amend either the stake or the odds requested by a customer, despite
                any non-runners or
                withdrawals. However, customers who have selected the SP limit option can reduce the minimum SP odds
                they are prepared to accept
                on a selection.
            </li>
            <li>For SP lay bets on win markets, it will reduce a customer's liability based on the reduction factor(s)
                of any non-runner(s) and
                the reduction factor of the runner on which the customer's bet has been placed. This is to ensure that
                the balance between the
                backers' stakes and the layers' liability reflects the revised market after the runner has been removed.
                For example, if a horse
                with a 50% reduction factor becomes a non-runner, then another horse in the same market priced at about
                5 (i.e. a reduction factor
                of 20%) will change to a price of about 2.5. Therefore, the liability on a £200 lay bet on that runner
                will need to change to a
                liability of about £75 to ensure that a balancing back bet will have the same £50 stake. This is done by
                multiplying the liability
                by 37.5% (i.e. 100%-(50%/ (100%-20%))).
            </li>
            <li>Where an SP lay bet in a win market has a maximum odds limit specified, this limit will be reduced by
                the reduction factor of any
                non-runner, if the non-runner has a reduction factor of at least 2.5%.
            </li>
            <li>For SP lay bets on place markets, it will still reduce a customer's liability based on the reduction
                factor(s) of any
                non-runner(s) but the calculation will be slightly different, in line with the application of place
                market reduction factors. The
                liability will be reduced by the reduction factor of the removed runner. Where the lay bet on a place
                market has a maximum odds
                limit specified, the potential winnings on the bet (i.e. the odds – 1) will be reduced by the reduction
                factor of the removed
                runner.
            </li>
            <li>Where an SP lay bet in a place market has a maximum odds limit specified this limit will be reduced by
                the reduction factor of any
                non-runner.
            </li>
            <li>SP lay bets will not be cancelled when there is a non-runner.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>➢ Specific conditions for SP bets for non-runners in greyhound racing markets</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>ALL SP bets will stand so long as your trap selection is not vacant or after your bet placement a
                reserve runner is not
                subsequently entered to run from your trap selection.
            </li>
            <li>ALL unmatched ‘Convert to SP’ bets will be cancelled when a reserve is added or a vacant trap removed.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>11. 'Keep' bets option</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>For markets that are scheduled to be turned in-play at the 'off', a customer can request that an
                unmatched Exchange bet should not
                be cancelled when the market is turned in-play. This is done by selecting the 'At In-Play: Keep' option
                in the bet manager (and
                confirming that request) and means that the unmatched bet persists when other unmatched bets are
                cancelled at the start of the
                event.
            </li>
            <li>As described above, when a non-runner is removed from a horseracing market (apart for late withdrawals
                as described in the next
                bullet point below), it is policy to cancel unmatched offers to lay all other horses in the market if
                the non-runner has a
                reduction factor of 2.5% or greater for win markets, or 4.0% or greater for place markets. In these
                circumstances offers to lay a
                horse with the 'At In-Play: Keep' option selected will not be cancelled. Instead the lay odds offered in
                place markets will be
                reduced in proportion with the reduction factors of any non-runner(s) and the same will apply in win
                markets providing the
                relevant non-runner has a reduction factor of at least 2.5%.
            </li>
            <li>When there is a late withdrawal, may not have time to remove the non-runner from the market before
                turning it in-play. In such
                cases if can determine that the late withdrawal is a material runner (i.e. a selection with a reduction
                factor of approx. 20% or
                greater in the win market), it reserves the right to cancel ALL lay 'keep' bets (in both the win and ‘to
                be placed’ markets)
                before turning the market in-play. If it does not cancel lay 'keep' bets in the case of a late
                withdrawal (for example, it may not
                be possible to know which horse is withdrawn, at the time of the off), any such bets placed before the
                off and matched in-play
                will remain at the original selected price. This means that those lay 'keep' bets will not be subject to
                any reduction factor
                which as a result of the late withdrawal, will be applied after the completion of the race to bets
                matched at or before the 'off'.
            </li>
            <li>Otherwise, in exceptional cases reserves the right to cancel 'keep' bets to protect customers but,
                unless stipulated in the market
                rules or the market information, the general principle is that at no point will a 'keep' bet be
                cancelled by unless it remains
                unmatched when the market is closed (for the final time) at the end of the event.
            </li>
            <li>For the avoidance of doubt this means that (for example) when a Material Event occurs in a soccer match
                and other unmatched bets
                are cancelled before the market is reopened, a keep bet will not be cancelled.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>12. Rules for Tote betting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>When you place a Tote bet on the platform (for example a UK or South African Tote bet), you are betting
                against as counterparty to
                your bet. I will then strike a corresponding bet into the relevant Tote pool as applicable.
            </li>
            <li>A link to the rules which apply to Tote bets struck as counterparty is provided within each of the
                relevant. If there is any
                conflict between those rules and either: the equivalent rules available on the relevant Tote website
                (for example on the UK Tote
                website in the case of UK Tote bets); or the equivalent rules applied by the relevant host racetrack,
                the rules on the relevant
                Tote website or applied by the relevant host racetrack, will prevail.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>13. Miscellaneous</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>All references to time periods in the Exchange Rules relate to the time zone in which the event takes
                place. For example, a
                reference to the start time of a football match, relates to the local kick-off time.
            </li>
            <li>All information is done so in good faith. However, it cannot accept liability for any errors or
                omissions in respect of any
                information, such as the posting of prices, runners, times, scores, results or general statistics.
            </li>
            <li>It reserves the right to correct any obvious errors and shall take all reasonable steps to ensure
                markets are administered with
                integrity and transparency.
            </li>
            <li>If an incorrect team or competitor name is displayed (excluding minor spelling mistakes) or the
                incorrect number of teams,
                competitors or outcomes is displayed in any complete market or a market is otherwise loaded using
                incorrect information (for
                example the application of an incorrect exposure algorithm or a cross matching tool utilising an
                incorrect algorithm) or includes
                any obvious error such as the incorrect deployment of the cross matching tool, then It reserves the
                right to suspend the market
                and (providing it acts reasonably) to void all bets matched on the market.
            </li>
            <li>Customers are responsible for ensuring that they satisfy themselves that the selection on which they
                place a bet is their intended
                selection. For example, in the case of a competitor bearing the same name as another individual not
                competing in the relevant
                event, the onus is on the customer to ensure that they know which competitor It has loaded into the
                relevant market and to ensure
                that they are placing their bet on their chosen competitor.
            </li>
            <li>It reserves the right at any time in its sole and absolute discretion to suspend an Exchange market.
            </li>
            <li>It may, in its sole and absolute discretion, decide to suspend betting on a market at any time (even if
                such suspension is earlier
                than anticipated by the Exchange Rules). In the interests of maintaining integrity and fairness in the
                markets, it may also void
                certain bets in a market or void a whole market in its entirety.
            </li>
            <li>It reserves the right to amend the Exchange Rules at any time.</li>
            <li>It reserves the right to cancel unmatched bets to protect customers at any time.</li>
            <li>
                On the settlement of any market, amounts relating to
                <ul>
                    <li>winnings/losses on bets; and</li>
                    <li>commission charges</li>
                </ul>
                will be rounded up or down to the nearest two decimal places (with the exception that rounding will
                always be down (and never up)
                in respect of amounts relating to winnings/losses in respect of BSP bets). By way of example, £3.333,
                will be settled as £3.33,
                whereas £3.335, will be settled as £3.34 (except that it will be settled as £3.33 in respect of an
                amount relating to
                winnings/losses in respect of BSP bets).
            </li>
            <li>The Exchange Rules have been prepared in various languages other than English for reference only. In the
                event of any differences
                between the English version and the non-English version, the English version shall prevail.

            </li>
            <li>If any player or team does not play a stroke on a hole all bets will be void.</li>
            <li>Markets are settled on completion of the hole and any subsequent penalties or disqualification will not
                be taken into account.

        <h3>13. Greyhound racing</h3>
        <h4>➢ General</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>All bets (excluding those struck on ante-post and Australian licensed markets) are placed on trap
                numbers. Greyhound names are
                displayed for information purposes only.
            </li>
            <li>Markets will be determined according to the official result at the time the track gives the result green
                light status, either in
                the form of an announcement or by display. Subsequent disqualifications, appeals or amendments to the
                result will be disregarded.
            </li>
            <li>If a non-runner or reserve runner is declared, then all bets prior to the update of the market on It
                will be void and all
                unmatched bets including ‘Take SP’ and ‘keep’ bets will be cancelled (except for certain SP bets as set
                out in Paragraph 10.5 of
                Part B above).
            </li>
            <li>If there are no finishers in any race or any race is declared void before the official result is
                declared then all bets will be
                void.
            </li>
            <li>If the scheduled venue is changed after the market has been loaded by It, all bets will be void.</li>
            <li>In ante-post markets, all bets on individual greyhounds stand whether the greyhound runs or not. All
                ante-post bets will be void
                if the competition is abandoned or the venue is changed.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>➢ Trap Challenge</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Bets on 'Trap challenge' markets are based on which trap results in the most winners during a race
                meeting, unless stated
                otherwise in the Market Information.
            </li>
            <li>These markets are unaffected by any changes due to non-runners or reserve runners.</li>
            <li>If a race results in a dead heat each trap will receive a half-win, with a 3-way dead heat giving a one
                third-win, and so on.</li>
            <li>Standard dead heat rules apply if two or more traps have an equal number of winners at the end of both
                meetings.</li>
            <li>If a whole meeting is abandoned all bets are void. However, if at least one race has been completed then
                bets on these markets
                will stand.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>➢ Multi-trap or Multiplied Trap Numbers</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>'Multi-trap' or 'multiplied trap numbers' bets are on the cumulative sum of the winning trap multiplied
                by the second trap for
                each race during a race meeting, unless stated otherwise in the Market Information. If the cumulative
                sum is not a round number
                then that sum shall be rounded up to give the applicable cumulative sum.
            </li>
            <li>These markets are unaffected by any changes due to non-runners or reserve runners.</li>
            <li>If a race is cancelled, void or abandoned or if there is only one finisher in a race, an eight
                runner-greyhound races will be
                allocated 20 points and all other races will be allocated 12 points.
            </li>
            <li>If a whole meeting is abandoned all bets are void however if at least one race has been completed then
                bets on these markets will
                stand with the remaining races allocated 20 points for eight runner greyhound races and 12 points for
                all other races.
            </li>
            <li>Re-run races will be treated as cancelled races.</li>
            <li>If there is a dead heat for the winner between two greyhounds then to calculate the applicable
                multi-trap number for that race the
                trap numbers for the greyhounds involved in the dead heat will be multiplied by each other to give the
                applicable multi-trap
                number.
            </li>
            <li>If there is a dead heat for the winner between three or more greyhounds then to calculate the applicable
                multi-trap number for
                that race the trap numbers for the greyhounds involved in the dead heat will be added up and divided by
                the number of greyhounds
                involved in the dead heat and the resulting number will be multiplied by itself to give the applicable
                multi-trap number (even if
                not a round number). By way of example: traps 1, 3 and 6 dead heat for first. Add these numbers up gives
                10; divide this number by
                the number of greyhounds in the dead heat (3) which gives a resulting number of 3.33; multiply 3.33 by
                itself to give 11.11.
            </li>
            <li>If there is a dead heat for the runner up between two or more greyhounds then to calculate the
                applicable multi-trap number for
                that race the trap numbers for the greyhounds involved in the dead heat will be added up and divided by
                the number of greyhounds
                involved in the dead heat and the resulting number will be multiplied by the number of the winner to
                give the applicable
                multi-trap number (even if not a round number). By way of example: trap 1 wins and traps 3 and 6 dead
                heat for second. Adding the
                numbers of the dead heating runners up gives 9; divide this number by the number of greyhounds in the
                dead heat (2) which gives a
                resulting number of 4.5; multiple 4.5 by the winning number (1) to give 4.5.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>➢ Winning Distances</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>'Winning distances' bets are on the sum of the winning distances for all races during a race meeting,
                unless otherwise stated in
                the Market Information.
            </li>
            <li>The maximum winning distance in any race is 10 lengths.</li>
            <li>If there is only one finisher in any race the winning distance will be deemed to be 10 lengths.</li>
            <li>If a race is cancelled, void or abandoned the winning distance will be deemed to be 2 lengths.</li>
            <li>Re-run races will be treated as cancelled races.</li>
            <li>For distances below half a length, the following scale will be applied: Short-head 0.1; Head 0.2; Neck
                0.3.</li>
            <li>The sum of all the winning distances will be rounded to the nearest whole number at the end of the
                meeting (rounded up, if half)
                and bets will be settled on this result.
            </li>
            <li>If a whole meeting is abandoned all bets are void. However, if at least one race has been completed then
                the remaining races are
                allocated 2 lengths each and bets will stand.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>➢ Match Bets</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>'Match Bets' for a race are determined by the greyhound with the highest finishing position in that
                race. If neither greyhound
                finishes the race bets are void. If only one of the greyhounds finishes the race, that greyhound will be
                deemed the winner. If a
                non-runner or reserve runner is declared then all bets will be void.
            </li>
            <li>'Match Bets' for progress in a competition are determined by the greyhound which qualifies to the
                furthest round (whether it runs
                in the further round or not). If the greyhounds concerned fail to qualify in the same round of the
                competition then the market
                will be settled as a dead heat, irrespective of their finishing positions in their individual heats.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>➢ Reverse Forecasts</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>'Reverse Forecast' markets are determined by those greyhounds placed first and second in a race.</li>
            <li>If a dead heat affects the reverse forecast then dead heat rules apply.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>➢ Place markets</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The number of winners in 'to be placed' markets is as set out in the Market Information and is
                determined with reference to the
                number of runners when the market is loaded.
            </li>
            <li>Once opened, the number of winners in 'to be placed' markets (as set out in the Market Information) will
                not be affected by
                further non-runners. If the number of potential winners is equal to or is greater than the number of
                runners, all bets in this
                market will be void.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>➢ To Reach the Final and To Qualify markets</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>'Reach the Final' markets shall be determined by the first six greyhounds who qualify from the Semi
                Finals of the competition and
                be settled as such regardless of whether they go on to run in the final or not.
            </li>
            <li>'To qualify' markets shall be determined by the greyhounds that qualify in the relevant heats
                irrespective of whether they run in
                the next round or not.
            </li>
            <li>The 'reach the final' or 'to qualify' markets will be settled after the qualifying stages and any
                subsequent disqualification or
                amendment to results will not count.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>➢ Ante-post</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>If a greyhound listed in an ante-post market dies, it will use the available information to determine
                the time of the greyhound's
                death. It will then, acting reasonably, determine whether the greyhound was a 'material runner' in the
                market. In determining
                whether a greyhound is a material runner, it will look at the general price of the greyhound immediately
                before the greyhound's
                death, in the market and in the wider betting market. Broadly, it will consider a greyhound to be a
                material runner if it is
                deemed to have an approximate chance of winning of 8-10 per cent or better.
            </li>
            <li>If It determines that the greyhound was a 'material runner', then all bets struck in the market (on all
                selections) between the
                time of death and the suspension of the market will be void and all unmatched bets will be cancelled
                before the market is
                reopened.
            </li>
            <li>If It determines that the greyhound was not a 'material runner', then just bets struck on the greyhound
                in question between the
                time of death and the suspension of the market will be void and unmatched bets will not be cancelled
                before the market is
                reopened.
            </li>
            <li>Bets matched on greyhounds after they have forfeited their entry at a particular entry stage or where
                they have not qualified by
                the applicable qualifying date will be voided unless the race in question has a subsequent supplementary
                entry stage.
            </li>
            <li>Where an event is postponed or rescheduled to another day at the same venue then ante-post bets will
                stand unless entries are
                reopened in which case all bets will be void.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>➢ Australian Specific Non-Runner Rules</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Notwithstanding any of the above, the following rules apply to declared non-runners in Australian
                greyhound markets.</li>
            <li>If a greyhound becomes a notified non-runner after the market is loaded but prior to the commencement of
                the race it will be
                removed and all bets on the market, matched prior to the update of the market will be voided.
            </li>
            <li>If, following the completion of a race, the stewards declare a greyhound a non-runner, it will resettle
                the market and will void
                all bets that were placed on that runner only. It will then apply a reduction factor to all bets placed
                on the winner (or place
                getters in the case of place markets) based on that runner’s weighted average price.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>14. Horseracing</h3>
        <h4>➢ General</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>All individual race markets will be determined according to the official result at the time of the
                'weigh-in' announcement (or
                equivalent). Subsequent disqualifications, appeals or amendments to the result will be disregarded.
            </li>
            <li>If a race is abandoned or otherwise declared void, or in the event of a walkover, all bets on that race
                will be void.</li>
            <li>If the scheduled venue is changed after the market has been loaded, all bets will be void.</li>
            <li>Where a race does not take part on its scheduled day, all bets will be void.</li>
            <li>If a scheduled surface type is changed (e.g. turf to dirt) all bets will stand.</li>
            <li>Horseracing Exchange Multiples are based on ‘day of the race’ markets (and not ante-post markets).
                Horseracing ante-post rules do
                not therefore apply in relation to horseracing Exchange Multiples.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>➢ Ante-post</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Subject to the points below, in ante-post markets, all bets on an individual horse stand whether the
                horse runs or not.</li>
            <li>For GB and Irish racing: if a horse is balloted out, all bets on that horse will be void.</li>
            <li>If a horse listed in an ante-post market dies, it will use the available information to determine the
                time of the horse's death.
                It will be acting reasonably, determine whether the horse was a 'material runner' in the market. It will
                undertake a similar
                determination in cases where it is advised through official channels that a runner has been formally
                scratched from an ante-post
                race. In determining whether a horse is a material runner, it will consider the general price of the
                horse immediately before the
                horse's death (or immediately before being advised it has been scratched), in the market and in the
                wider betting market. Broadly,
                it will consider a horse to be a material runner if it is deemed to have an approximate chance of
                winning of 8-10 per cent or
                better.
            </li>
            <li>If it determines that the horse was a 'material runner', then all bets struck in the market (on all
                selections) between the time
                of death (or the time that the formal scratching notification was created) and the suspension of the
                market will be void and all
                unmatched bets will be cancelled before the market is reopened.
            </li>
            <li>If it determines that the horse was not a 'material runner', then just bets struck on the horse in
                question between the time of
                death (or the time that the formal scratching notification was created) and the suspension of the market
                will be void and
                unmatched bets will not be cancelled before the market is reopened.
            </li>
            <li>Bets matched on horses after they have forfeited their entry at a particular entry stage or where they
                have not qualified by the
                applicable qualifying date will be voided unless the race in question has a subsequent supplementary
                entry stage.
            </li>
            <li>Please be aware that runners who have not been entered at the various entry stages may be removed from
                relevant race markets and
                all matched customer bet prices set to 1.0 even if there are later supplementary stages. Should it
                appear likely that a specific
                runner may actually be supplemented into the race this runner will be reinstated with all matched
                customer bets set back to the
                original prices.
            </li>
            <li>No Non-Runner Rule' reductions are made to ante-post bets.</li>
            <li>All relevant bets will be void where an event is: abandoned and not rescheduled; or postponed and
                rescheduled to another venue; or
                postponed and rescheduled to another day at the same venue with entries for the race being reopened or
                reverting back to a
                previous entry or declaration stage provided any additional horses are entered or re-entered and such
                entries or declarations are
                considered, in absolute discretion, material to the betting on the race. For the avoidance of doubt,
                where a race is postponed and
                rescheduled to another day at the same venue, relevant bets will stand where entries/declarations at the
                time of postponement
                remain unaltered or include any non-material addition(s) prior to the rescheduled race.

        <h4>➢ Place Terms for Exchange markets</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The number of winners in 'to be placed' markets is as set out in the Market Information and is
                determined with reference to the
                number of runners when the market is loaded.
            </li>
            <li>Once opened, the number of winners in 'to be placed' markets will not be affected by further

                than decimal odds, so the calculation of the Place odds corresponding to Win odds of 8.0 in this market
                is ((8.0 – 1) / 5) + 1 =
                2.4.
            </li>
            <li>Once opened, the number of places in 'EW” markets will not be affected by further non-runners unless the
                number of ‘places’ which
                are offered on the ‘Each Way’ market is equal to or exceeds the number of runners in which case, the
                place portion of any EW bet
                will be voided at settlement.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>➢ Winning Distance Bets</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Unless stated otherwise in the Market Information, winning distances' bets are on the sum of the winning
                distances from each race
                on one particular day at a race meeting.
            </li>
            <li>The winning distance in a race will be the officially declared distance between the first two horses
                past the post. However, if
                either the first or second horse past the post is disqualified because: (i) of an incorrect weight
                carried; (ii) they have taken
                the wrong course; (iii) the jockey of either horse fails to weigh in, or weighs in light after the race;
                then in each case the
                winning distance shall be that between the first and second horse under the official result.
            </li>
            <li>
                For the purpose of this bet, the maximum distance on any individual race will be 12 lengths for Flat
                races and 30 lengths for
                National Hunt races (which includes National Hunt Flat Races) and these distances will be applied where
                only one horse finishes a
                race. For distances below half a length, the following scale will be applied:
                <ul>
                    <li>Nose: 0.05 length</li>
                    <li>Short-head: 0.1</li>
                    <li>Head: 0.2</li>
                    <li>Short-neck: 0.25</li>
                    <li>Neck: 0.3</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If a meeting has three or more races abandoned or declared void, then all 'winning distance' bets will
                be void, unless the entire
                market has been unconditionally determined.
            </li>
            <li>When only one or two races are abandoned or declared void, then 'winning distance' bets will be settled
                with a default distance
                used for each abandoned or void race. The default distances are 2 lengths for Flat races and 10 lengths
                for National Hunt races.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the case of a walkover the following distances will be applied:
                <ul>
                    <li>Flat: 5 lengths</li>
                    <li>National Hunt: 12 lengths</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>➢ Non-Runner Rule</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Non-runner rule relates to the adjustment of odds on bets already matched when a horse in a race is
                declared a non-runner. In
                order to make the adjustment applies a reduction factor to the remaining runners. The reduction factor
                allocated to a non-runner
                is a calculation (the details of which are described below) of that horse's chances of winning (or being
                placed, etc. as
                appropriate) and is applied to bets already matched on the other runners in the relevant market or
                markets.
            </li>
            <li>Any horse listed when the relevant market is loaded which does not subsequently come under starter's
                orders is deemed to be a
                non-runner.
            </li>
            <li>When the market is loaded each horse is given a 'reduction factor', based on a forecast price, which is
                expressed as a percentage.
                These reduction factors may be updated periodically at the discretion based on trading in the market,
                but after approximately 15
                minutes (approximately 5 minutes for Australian and US markets) from the scheduled 'off' time of a given
                race, they will be
                updated only in exceptional circumstances.
            </li>
            <li>Reductions will be made to both win and place markets but applied differently (as described below), and
                horses will have a
                different reduction factor for each market.
            </li>
            <li>As soon as becomes aware that a horse is an official non-runner or a highly likely non-runner, following
                a statement to the press
                from connections, the following will happen:
            </li>
            <li>All matched bets on that horse will be void and the horse will be removed from the market.</li>
            <li>In the win market: if the reduction factor of the non-runner is 2.5% or greater, the traded price of all
                the matched bets on the
                remaining horses will be reduced by an amount equal to the non-runner's final reduction factor and all
                the unmatched offers to lay
                will be cancelled. If the non-runner's reduction factor is less than 2.5%, reductions will not be
                applied and unmatched bets will
                not be cancelled.
            </li>
            <li>In the place market, the reduction factor of all non-runners will be applied (even if less than 2.5%)
                and the potential winnings
                in relation to matched bets on the remaining horses will be reduced by an amount equal to the
                non-runner's final reduction factor.
                Only if the non-runner's reduction factor is 4.0% or greater will all the unmatched offers to lay be
                cancelled.
            </li>
            <li>All the reduction factors on the remaining horses will be adjusted to reflect their improved chance of
                winning.</li>
            <li>Reduction factors are not applied to bets which are struck in-play. However, if a market is turned
                in-play prematurely by error
                (or, for example, there is a false start), all bets matched during this time will be subject to any
                later reduction factor,
                provided the market is turned out of play before the race commences. In the event of a late withdrawal,
                it reserves the right to
                remove the runner after completion of the race. In this case only those bets matched prior to the off
                will be affected by a
                reduction factor.
            </li>
            <li>In the event of a non-runner being removed from a race in error or following incorrect information
                regarding a runner’s
                participation, it will reinstate both the runner and all previously matched bets associated with that
                runner. All bets made
                between the time of withdrawal and reinstatement will be void in both the place market and the win
                market. The reduction factor
                applied to matched bets at the time of withdrawal will be reversed and the original prices will become
                valid.
            </li>
            <li>Any non-runners will be removed from the relevant markets in the order in which they are brought to
                attention. If It becomes aware
                of more than one non-runner at the same time, it will remove the non-runners from the relevant markets
                in race card order.
            </li>
            <li>If a runner is not included in a market because of an error or because of incorrect information
                regarding a runner’s
                participation, It reserve the right to introduce the missing runner into the market at any time prior to
                settlement (even after
                the race has been run), provided that It has determined that the missing runner is not a material runner
                (i.e. a selection with a
                reduction factor of approx. 2.5% or less in the win market). In such circumstances, all pre-play
                unmatched and matched bets will
                stand, however if the runner is not introduced before the start of the race, all in-play bets will be
                void. However, if the
                missing runner is deemed to be a material runner, then the malformed market will be void and a new
                market will be loaded where
                possible.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>➢ How the Reductions are applied for Exchange markets</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>In the win market, reductions will be made on the traded price.</li>
            <li>For example: if the non-runner's final reduction factor is 25% the traded price on all previously
                matched bets on other horses
                will be reduced by 25% - traded price of 8.0 would become 6.0 etc. And these might be further reduced if
                another horse is
                subsequently declared a non-runner.
            </li>
            <li>In the EW Market, reductions will be made on the traded win price. The advertised place terms will then
                apply to the revised win
                prices.
            </li>
            <li>For example: if the non-runner's final reduction factor is 25% the traded price on all previously
                matched bets on other horses
                will be reduced by 25% - - traded price of 8.0 would become 6.0. If each Way terms were 1/5th odds for 3
                places, the corresponding
                price for the Place portion of the bet would reduce from 2.4 to 2.0.
            </li>
            <li>In the place market, reductions will be made to the potential winnings on the bet only, and not the
                traded price.</li>
            <li>For example: if the non-runner's final reduction factor is 25% the potential winnings on all previously
                matched bets on the other
                horses will be reduced by 25% - a traded price of 8.0 would become 6.25. For example, a £10 bet on a
                horse to be placed at a
                traded price of 8.0 would provide winnings of £70. If there is a non-runner with a reduction factor of
                25% in the race, that
                factor will be applied to the £70 of potential winnings leaving potential winnings of £52.50. Therefore,
                the revised traded price
                will be 6.25.
            </li>
            <li>The traded price may be further reduced if any other horse(s) is subsequently declared a non-runner,
                however odds cannot be
                reduced below 1.01.
            </li>
            <li>Reserves: A reserve runner may appear in the relevant markets but will have a non-applicable reduction
                factor until It has
                received confirmation that it is a confirmed runner, in which case an applicable reduction factor may
                apply to it.
            </li>
            <li>For the avoidance of doubt, any reduction factor applicable to a non-runner replaced by a reserve, will
                be applied to all bets
                struck on the relevant markets, prior to the removal from those markets of such non-runner. Likewise,
                should a reserve runner
                become a confirmed runner but subsequently become a non-runner, any reduction factor applicable to such
                non-runner will be applied
                to all bets struck on the relevant markets, prior to the removal from those markets of such non-runner.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>➢ Additional rules</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Card numbers are posted as a guide only: bets are placed on a named horse.</li>
            <li>Horses will not be coupled.</li>
            <li>Where any horse(s) runs for purse money only it is deemed a non-runner for betting purposes. Should this
                result in the number of
                possible winners stated in the relevant Market Information being equal to or greater than the number of
                runners in the relevant
                market, all bets in the market will be void.

            <li>If a match does not start on the scheduled start date and is not completed within three days of the
                scheduled start date, all bets
                will be void except for those on markets which have been unconditionally determined.
            </li>
            <li>If a match starts but is later abandoned or postponed then, within three days of the scheduled start
                date, (a) at least 55 minutes
                of play must have elapsed in any match; or (b) an official result must be 'called' by the relevant

                in any match where an
                official result is declared.
            </li>
            <li>For 'time of first try' bets, if the try is scored in the second half, the first half is deemed to have
                lasted 40 minutes,
                regardless of stoppage-time. If no try is scored, or the try is scored in second half stoppage-time or
                extra-time, the result is
                80.
            </li>
            <li>For the purpose of markets involving tries, penalty tries will count with the exception of 'first
                individual try scorer' markets
                where penalty tries will not count.
            </li>
            <li>If a match starts but is abandoned before its completion, all bets will be void unless an official
                result is declared by the
                applicable governing body. Where an official result has been declared by the official governing body,
                that official result will
                govern match and handicap market settlement but all other markets will be void unless their result has
                already been determined at
                the point of abandonment (i.e. at the point of abandonment, it would not have been possible for the
                outcome of the bet to change
                had the match continued to its natural conclusion). By way of example, if 37 points have been scored at
                the time a match is
                abandoned: (i) a bet placed on 35 points or more to be scored would be settled as a winning bet, (ii) a
                bet placed on 30-35 points
                to be scored would be settled as a losing bet and (iii) a bet placed on 40-45 points to be scored would
                be void. In such
                circumstances, bets on last try scorer / team to score last / team to score last try / last scoring play
                would all be void.

            <li>If a match has not started (or believes that a match will not have started) by 23:59 (local time) on its
                scheduled start date,
                then all bets will be void unless it has knowledge that the match has been rescheduled to be played
                within three days of its
                original start date.
            </li>
            <li>If a match starts but is later abandoned or postponed and believes that the match will not have been
                completed by 23:59 (local
                time) on its scheduled start date, then all markets, with the exception of any unconditionally
                determined markets, will be void
                unless it has knowledge that the match has been rescheduled to be played within three days of its
                original start date. If it does
                have knowledge that the game will be played within three days and the game is played within three days,
                then all bets will stand
                except if the match is restarted from the beginning. If the match is restarted from the beginning then
                all bets matched before the
                market went in-play will stand, but any bets placed in-play will be void, except for any bets placed
                in-play on markets which have
                been unconditionally determined, which will stand.
            </li>
            <li>For Friendly matches, all bets apply to the full duration of play according to the match officials, plus
                any stoppage time. If a
                friendly match starts but is later abandoned or postponed and is not completed (i.e. the full duration
                of play according to match
                officials, plus any stoppage time) within three days of the scheduled start date, all bets will be void
                except for those on
                markets which have been unconditionally determined. In the case of ambiguity over the official result
                from match officials, the
                outcome will be determined (acting reasonably) using information from independent sources.
            </li>
            <li>If an official fixture lists different team details to those listed (for example, the team name,
                reserves, age group, gender,
                etc.), then all bets matched on the affected markets will be void. In all other cases, bets will stand
                (including instances where
                a team name is listed without specifying the term 'XI' in the name). If an official fixture is shown on
                the website under an
                incorrect competition name, then it reserves the right to void all bets matched on the affected markets.
            </li>
            <li>If a team is relegated from a league because, at the end of a season, it has finished within the
                relegation positions which are
                relevant to that league (i.e. usually any of the bottom three league positions), bets on that team to be
                relegated will be settled
                as winning bets. If a team is otherwise disqualified, thrown out or removed from a league (i.e. in
                circumstances other than those
                where it has finished the season within the relevant relegation positions): (i) if such team is
                disqualified, thrown out or
                removed from the league before the relevant season has started, all bets on the affected market will be
                void (and a new market
                will subsequently be loaded) and (ii) if such team is disqualified, thrown out or removed from the
                league after the relevant
                season has started (or a determination is made by the applicable governing body, during the season, that
                the team will be thrown
                out or removed from the league following the season’s conclusion), all bets on the affected team will be
                void. For the avoidance
                of doubt, if a points deduction is imposed on a team such that it finishes the season within the
                relegation places which are
                relevant to the applicable league, bets on that team to be relegated will be settled as winning bets.
            </li>
            <li>The relevant season will be deemed to have started once the first league game has been played. For the
                purposes of this rule,
                markets relating to individual matches will not be deemed to be "affected markets".
            </li>
            <li>'Shirt numbers' bets will refer to the shirt number allocated at the start of the match. 'Shirt numbers'
                bets will include
                own-goal scorers. Any player whose shirt bears no number will be allocated the number 12.
            </li>
            <li>For 'time of first goal' bets (i.e. "First Goal Odds" markets), the first half is deemed to last 45
                minutes, regardless of
                stoppage time. Also for these markets, please note that the "0 - 10 Minutes" selection covers the first
                10 minutes of the match.
                In other words, it runs from 0:00 until just before the clock hits 10:00. The "11 – 20 Minutes"
                selection runs from 10:00 until
                just before the clock hits 20:00. The same principle applies to each of the other selections in this
                market.
            </li>
            <li>For 'top goal scorer' markets only the goals scored in the league or competition stated in the Market
                Information count. For
                example, if a player joins a club mid-season any goals scored in a different league will not count,
                however goals scored for a
                different club in the same league will count. Own goals will not count.
            </li>
            <li>In markets which relate to the number of incidents to occur, such as 'number of corners', these will be
                determined on the basis of
                the number taken, rather than awarded.
            </li>
            <li>For markets that relate to the number of bookings given, the number of corners taken, any goal scorer or
                the time of a particular
                goal, the result will be determined (acting reasonably) using information from independent sources. In
                such cases, if any new
                information comes into the public domain within 48 hours of settlement, then it shall (acting
                reasonably) determine either: (i)
                whether the market should be reinstated or resettled in light of this new information; or (ii) to wait
                for further information
                before deciding whether to reinstate or resettle the market. Except it has announced that it is waiting
                for further information,
                any information that comes into the public domain more than 48 hours after a market has been settled
                shall not be considered
                (regardless of whether or not such information may have led to a different result).

                next round (or winning
                the tournament in the case of a final) will be deemed the winner. However, if less than one set has been
                completed at the time of
                the retirement or disqualification then all bets relating to that individual match will be void.
            </li>
            <li>All bets relating to the number of occurrences of certain events within a tournament will be void if the
                tournament is reduced in
                length, postponed or cancelled, except for those on markets which have been unconditionally determined.
            </li>
            <li>All bets will stand regardless of changes to scheduled venues, including any changes to a different type
                of surface.</li>
            <li>If the scheduled duration of a match is reduced or increased in the number of games/sets required to
                win, all bets will be void
                except for those on markets which have been unconditionally determined. Please note that this does not
                apply to ‘Match Odds’ or
                ‘Set Winner’ markets on Davis Cup matches or ‘dead rubber’ matches that have been shortened from five
                sets to three sets after the
                market has been loaded, provided that the match has been shortened in accordance with the competition’s
                rules.
            </li>
            <li>Where markets are offered on individual games or sets within a match, a retirement or disqualification
                during a game or set will
                render bets on that game or set market and all individual game or set markets void except those on
                markets which have been
                unconditionally determined.

        <h3>KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER POLICY</h3>
        <p>To maintain the highest level of security, we require all our members to provide us with certain
            documentation in order to validate their
            accounts.</p>
        <p>Please note that the identification procedures shall be done before a cardholder starts operating and using
            services of our merchants.</p>

        <h3>Why do I need to provide documentation?</h3>
        <p>There are several reasons:</p>
        <p>We are committed to providing a socially responsible platform for online gaming. All of our members must be
            18 or older and we are bound by
            our licensing agreement to verify this.</p>
        <p>Secondly, as a respected online and global company it is in our interests to guarantee maximum security on
            all transactions.</p>
        <p>Thirdly, our payment processors require that our policies are in line with international banking standards. A
            proven business relationship
            with each and every member is mandatory for the protection of all parties. Our licensing agreement also
            obliges us to comply with
            this.</p>
        <p>Finally, by ensuring that your account details are absolutely correct, the inconvenience of 'missing
            payments' can be avoided. It can take
            weeks (and sometimes months) to trace, recall and resend using the correct information. This lengthy process
            also results in additional
            fees from our processors.</p>

        <h3>WHAT DOCUMENTS DO I NEED TO PROVIDE?</h3>
        <p>PROOF OF ID:</p>
        <p>A color copy of a valid government issued form of ID (Driver's License, Passport, State ID or Military ID)
        </p>

        <h3>PROOF OF ADDRESS:</h3>
        <p>A copy of a recent utility bill showing your address</p>
        <p>Note: If your government Id shows your address, you do not need to provide further proof of address.</p>
        <p>Additional documentation might be required depending on the withdrawal method you choose</p>

        <h3>When do I need to provide these documents?</h3>
        <p>We greatly appreciate your cooperation in providing these at your earliest possible convenience to avoid any
            delays in processing your
            transactions. We must be in receipt of the documents before any cash transactions can be sent back to you.
            Under special circumstances we
            may require the documents before further activity (deposits and wagering) can take place on your account</p>
        <p>Please understand, if we do not have the required documents on file, your pending withdrawals will be
            cancelled and credited back to your
            account. You will be notified when this happens via the notification system.</p>

        <h3>How can I send you these documents?</h3>
        <p>Please scan your documents, or take a high quality digital camera picture, save the images as jpegs, then
            upload the files using our secure
            form.</p>

        <h3>How do I know my documents are safe with you?</h3>
        <p>The security of your documentation is of paramount importance. All files are protected with the highest level
            of encryption at every step
            of the review process. All documentation received is treated with the utmost respect and confidentiality.

        <p>{{domain}} is committed to endorsing responsible wagering among its customers as well as promoting the
            awareness of problem
            gambling and improving prevention, intervention and treatment.</p>

        <p>{{domain}}’s Responsible Gambling Policy sets out its commitment to minimizing the negative effects of
            problem gambling and to
            promoting responsible gambling practices.</p>

        <p>{{domain}} supports the generation of online gamblers offering them a wide range of games and entertainment.
            We also take
            responsibility for our product line-up.</p>

        <p>The aim of {{domain}} is to provide the world’s safest and most innovative gaming platform for adults. The
            offered clear and safe
            products allow each user to play within his financial means and to receive the highest quality service.
            Integrity, fairness and
            reliability are the guiding principles of {{domain}}’s work. It is therefore clear that {{domain}} should do
            its best
            to avoid and reduce the problems, which can arise from participation in gambling, particularly in cases of
            immoderate playing. At the same
            time it is important to respect the rights of those who take part in games of chance to a reasonable extent
            as means of entertainment.</p>

        <p>Responsible Gaming at {{domain}} is based on three fundamental principles: Security of the player, Security
            of the game and
            Protection against gaming addiction. Together with research institutes, associations and therapy
            institutions, we work on creation of a
            responsible, secure and reliable framework for online gaming.</p>

        <p><strong>Player security</strong></p>
        <p>We take responsibility for the security of our players. Protection of the players is based on forbidding the
            attendance of the minors from
            participation in games and the protection of privacy, which involves responsible processing of personal data
            and payments. Fairness and
            the random nature of the products offered are monitored closely by independent organizations. Marketing
            communication is also geared
            towards player protection: we promise only what players can receive in our transparent line.</p>

        <p><strong>Protection against gaming addiction: research – prevention – intervention</strong></p>
        <p>The majority of users who make sports bets, casino bets and other gaming offers play in moderation for
            entertainment. Certain habits and
            behavior patterns (such as shopping, playing sports, eating or consumption of alcohol) which are considered
            to be normal and not causing
            any concern can develop into addiction for some people and cause problems. In the same way, bets on sports
            and gambling can lead to
            problems for a small group of customers.</p>
        <p>Clients with gaming addiction are prohibited from further participation in the gaming line-up. Subsequently
            the customers are provided with
            contacts of organizations where they can receive professional advice and support.</p>

        <p><strong>Self-responsibility is the most sustainable form of prevention</strong></p>
        <p>The basic principle promoted by {{domain}} is that the final decision and responsibility on whether to play
            or not, and how much
            money can be spent on the game should be assumed by the customer himself.</p>
        <p>Self-responsibility of the customer is therefore the most effective form of protection from addiction.
            {{domain}} sees its
            responsibility in assisting the customers by providing transparent products, full information and keeping a
            clear line of conduct.</p>

        <p><strong>Protection of minors</strong></p>
        <p>{{domain}} does not allow minors (persons under the age of 18) to participate in games and make bets. That’s
            why the confirmation
            of having reached the age of majority and the confirmation of date of birth are mandatory requirements
            during
            registration. {{domain}} considers the issue of minors taking part in games and betting very seriously. In
            order to offer the
            best possible protection of minors, we also rely on the support of parents and caregivers. Please keep your
            data for account access in a
            safe place (user ID and password).</p>

        <p>Furthermore, we would recommend that you install filter software. This software will allow you to restrict
            the access to Internet resources
            inappropriate for children and teenagers.</p>

        <p><strong>Responsibility towards problems</strong></p>
        <p>{{domain}} offers a variety of games and bets, which are forms of entertainment for the majority of
            customers. At the same time
            the company takes responsibility for its customers by providing support and tools for maintenance of a
            secure and entertaining environment
            taking into account the associated risks.</p>
        <p>The clients who have difficulty in assessing risks, recognizing their own limits or those who suffer from
            gambling addiction are not able
            to enjoy our product line-up responsibly and perceive it as a form of entertainment. {{domain}} takes
            responsibility for such
            users by blocking their access to its products for their own protection.</p>

        <p><strong>Get informed with the main issues!</strong></p>
        <p>Most people play for pleasure. Moderate participation in games within their financial capacity is fully
            acceptable. However, for a small
            percentage of people gambling is not a form of entertainment, it is a challenge that must be considered
            seriously.</p>

        <p><strong>What is the problematic game behavior?</strong></p>
        <p>A problematic game behavior is considered to be such behavior, which interferes mode of life, work, financial
            position or health of a
            person or his family. Long participation in games is counter indicative to such person as it can lead to
            negative consequences.</p>
        <p>In 1980 the pathological game dependence has been officially recognized and enlisted in the list of
            psychological diseases of international
            classification system DSM-IV and ICD-10. It is defined as long, repeating and frequently amplifying
            inclination for game, despite of
            existing negative personal and social circumstances, such as a debt, rupture of family relations and delay
            of professional growth.</p>

        <p><strong>In what cases behavior of a person should be considered as dependence?</strong></p>
        <p>It is necessary to underline that the diagnoses of game dependence can be qualified only by experts. The
            material presented on this
            web-page will help you to estimate and define your own game behaviour.</p>
        <p>The special hazard of addictions that are not associated with any substance is that it is very difficult to
            define the line between
            pleasure and addiction. Nevertheless, there are some diagnostic signals that may point out the existing
            problems. In the presence of at
            least five of the following symptoms, the likelihood of the severe dependence is high:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The player is deeply involved in gambling, all his thoughts are only about the game.</li>
            <li>Bet sum increases in course of time.</li>
            <li>Attempts to quit or control his participation in the games appear to be unsuccessful.</li>
            <li>When limiting his participation in gambling, a person experiences irritation and disappointment.</li>
            <li>The game is a way to escape from problems or discomfort.</li>
            <li>The player tries to win back the lost amount,</li>
            <li>Lies about his playing behavior,</li>
            <li>Commits illegal acts,</li>
            <li>Spoils or breaks the relationship with family and colleagues,</li>
            <li>Borrows to participate in the games.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Rules for responsible games</strong></p>
        <p>Following the rules placed below, you can enjoy the game without anxiety:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Start playing only when you are calm and concentrated.</li>
            <li>Take regular breaks.</li>
            <li>Define for yourself beforehand the monthly amount you can spend on the game.</li>
            <li>Once setting a maximum limit, do not further increase it.</li>
            <li>Before you start playing, define the maximum amount of winning, after reaching of which you should stop
                playing.</li>
            <li>Define the amount you can afford to lose beforehand.</li>
            <li>Do not start playing under alcohol or drug influence.</li>
